Coursera ML Final Assignment (MK)

Overview:

This repository contains the final assignment for the "Machine Learning with Python" course offered by IBM on Coursera. The project focuses on predicting Australian weather using various machine learning algorithms implemented in a single Colab notebook.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project contains historical Australian weather data, including features such as Date, MinTemp, MaxTemp, Rainfall, Evaporation, Sunshine, WindGustDir, WindGustSpeed, WindDir9am, WindDir3pm	...	Humidity9am, Humidity3pm, Pressure9am, Pressure3pm, Cloud9am, Cloud3pm, Temp9am, Temp3pm, RainToday. The target variable is RainTomorrow.
